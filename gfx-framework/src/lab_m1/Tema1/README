Duck Hunt game:

The duck spawns below the ground in random spawn point and with random angles.

You can shoot it.
Every shot reduces your number of total bullets by 1.
If you shoot the bird, the bird goes down and dies, increasing your progress bar.
You can't shoot the bird if:
    * it is evading (going up because you didn't kill it in the time allocated)
    * it is below the ground (logically)
    * the game is paused (press P at any time to press the game)
    * the bird is rotating in the middle of the screen (meaning you lost all your lives and lost OR you completed your progress bar)

After a time, the bird will evade, reducing your total number of lives by 1.
Also, if you shoot all your 3 bullets and miss, it will also evade.

If the bird is going down / up (evading or dying), you can no longer shoot almost anything, shooting won't have an impact.
You can still shoot the ground (thought it would be fun from a game design perspective, although there are no fun things
to shoot (i thought about chickens like in CS:GO or interactive stuff to shoot with your bullets until the next level starts - 
the next duck is spawned)).

Spawning a new bird after one disappears (either evades or is killed) - it is spawned at a random spawn point.
After each 5 birds, the speed is increased.
